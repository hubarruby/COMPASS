COMPASS: Calculating Orientation and Measuring Pointing Angle for Scientific Systems

This is the data-analysis portion of a student-led scientific ballooning project, designed to measure and verify the pointing direction of a balloon payload while in-flight. The project was funded by NASA through the Louisiana Space Grant Consortium, and the payload (for data collection) was flown in September 2021 on the High-Altitude Student Ballooning Platform (HASP). The project was completed in December, 2021. 

Research and payload design/construction was conducted by LSU undergraduate students Jeanne Garriz (team lead), Sabrina Huezo (electronics), Jesse Frank (in-flight software), and Harrison Gietz (me!) (post-flight analysis).

The Project was overseen by LSU Faculty member Aaron Ryan and LSU Professor T. Gregory Guzik. Results were presented at the 2021 American Geophysical Union Conference.

Disclaimer: This is not the complete project code, but just a portion of the analysis written by me.
